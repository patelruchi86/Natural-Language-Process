NLP model for analyzing & categorizing news content

Task: Develope an NLP model for creating and analyzing news content and getting major keywords from a bundle of news and also getting a quick summary to understand the news flow and trend in news.

Why do we use Topic modeling for news articles? Because We live in the era where streaming of the data is continuously collected on every seconds from different platforms and to get the quick insights of the collected data is very time consuming and tedious task. Topic modeling techniques are designed in such a way that it helps to organize, search, and understand the large quantities of the collected textual information very easily. Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm specifically for natural language processing to find the hidden semantic pattern from the large collection of textual data, generally called corpus. Where the characteristic of the cluster is determined by the data driven pattern. Each documents represents as vector of words or bag of words representation, where the vector-based clustering techniques is used and learned clustered center represents the prototype documents .

For this project, I have scraped the data from google news API and that includes the news titles from top 50 news portal, which is trending in current instances as it will scraping the latest news articles for that moment or near past to that, so we can have latest new articles to see what the major and breaking news articles are in trend for current situations. And we can further influence the people and target as many people as possible for related groups.
